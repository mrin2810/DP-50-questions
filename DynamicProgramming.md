# Dynamic Programming

### What is Dynamic Programming (DP)?
- Enhanced Recursion
- A problem has to first be recursion problem for it to be DP.

### How to identify DP questions?
- We will have a choice (e.g. knapsack, include an item or not)
- Usually if there are more than 2 recursive calls, it could be a (overlapping problem of recursion)
- We will be asked to calculate something Optimal

### How to proceed with DP problem?
- First approach that we have to write is "Recursive" function
- Then, memoize it.
- Top-down approach.
